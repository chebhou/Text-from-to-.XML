# Text  from/to .XML
blender addon to export/import text objects as .XML file

the addon is useful when  you need to edit a lot of text objects externaly , you can export them to .xml file and edit them then synchronize them with the import function (no other properties will be changed only the body "content" of the text object is updated )
